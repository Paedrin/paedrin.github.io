Hello readers! Welcome to my blog.

My name is Sebastian but I go under the tag of Paedrin or PaedrinTV. That nickname or tag comes from a book I've read and is one of the main characters of that book, the credit go to Jeff Wheeler for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fireblood-Whispers-Mirrowen-Book-1-ebook/dp/B008LWDHKO">Whispers from Mirrowen series</a>.

This blog will focus on my interests and experiences as a twitch streamer. I would like to document all the frustrations, challanges and excitement of being a streamer.

I started streaming for a bunch of reasons, the main one is as an exercise of self improvement. I believe that twitch is a platform that I can use to become better in general, the main focuses would probably be: sticking to a schedule, improved networking abilities and learning to keep a social media presence.

I hope I'll see y'all in chat, follow me at twitch.tv/paedrintv .

I do not seek donations or financial support currently, however if you'd like to show your love feel free to promote me in any way you like, and thank you for your support!

I will not update this blog too often as it is not my main focus, I am using it as a platform to share who I am and what I like, that's not going to change too often!

Follow me on twitter for updates on my stream and blog!
